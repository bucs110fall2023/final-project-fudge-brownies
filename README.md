## ATP

1. Action: Click the d button on the keyboard and move the Mouse and draw across the screen and then press d again. Result: A group of epigraphs should appear and draw out the shape drawn
2. Action: Click Space button. Result: the applications should go from the gameloop to the menuloop with different options
3. Action: Move the mouse around and click on the different buttons. Result: The application should change between different menu screens
4. Action: Using the mouse, from the main menu click the options button, and then click the color button, and then select a button before returning to the main gameloop, and then draw an image. Result: The drawing should be using the color that was selected
5. Action: Click the d keyboard button and move the Mouse and draw across the screen and then press d again. While the shape is being drawn, press the R button on the keyboard.
